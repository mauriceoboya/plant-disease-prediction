# Plant Disease Prediction
## Introduction

This project aims to predict diseases in plants using machine learning techniques. Detecting diseases in plants at an early stage is crucial for ensuring crop health and maximizing yield. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project offers a solution to identify and classify diseases in plants based on input images.
## Features

    Image-based disease prediction: Users can input images of plants, and the system will predict whether the plant is diseased and, if so, classify the disease.
    Multi-class classification: The system can classify plants into multiple disease categories, providing detailed information about the detected disease.
    User-friendly interface: The project provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and view the prediction results.
